# App Academy

### Homework from course

This repo is a collection of many homework I've done through out [AppAcademy](http://open.appacademy.io) course

Feel free to explore each folder, they may have instructions some times. Other times I got lazy or forgot to add one.
In the next commits or so I will try to update each project(homework), and add some description (or not)
